        <h2>The Purpose of ProgWorld</h2>
        <p>I, the creator of this page, designed it with the primary intention of helping those aspiring
            fans and connoisseurs of Progressive music along the path to familiarity with the art form. Not only with 
        the albums and bands of prog, but with the stories and ideas each song aims to convey. I intend to do this by 
        presenting a set of bands and albums I consider to be not only essential, but revolutionary within the genre; the cream of
        the crop within a genre already oversaturated with imagination and originality.
