        <h1>The intersections between art and entertainment,
            as seen in mainstream entertainment industries. 
        </h1>
        <p> When addressing the possibility of mainstream films, music,
            or video games transcending the status of dispassionate entertainment to
            become something infinitely more meaningful and culturally significant, we 
            must first keep in mind that there is a very strong correlation between how 
            unique, meaningful, and emotional a piece of commercial art is, and how much
            attention it will recieve from the general population of consumers, leading 
            directly to the amount of money it will make.
