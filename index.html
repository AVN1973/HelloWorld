        <h2>The Purpose of ProgWorld</h2>
        <p>I, the creator of this page, designed it with the primary intention of helping those aspiring
            fans and connoisseurs of Progressive music along the path to familiarity with the art form. Not only with 
        the albums and bands of prog, but with the stories and ideas each song aims to convey. I intend to do this by 
        presenting a set of bands and albums I consider to be not only essential, but revolutionary within the genre; the cream of
        the crop within a medium already oversaturated with innovation and originality.

       <h3>Selling England by the pound</h3>

       <p>Elegant, Avant-Garde, and just a bit gloomy, the cover of this album sums up the music very well. Almost 
           giving you the impression that it will be predictable, until you place it in your record player and drop
            the needle. Fifty-three minutes later you will undoubtedly find yourself longing to return to the magical
             world you just weightlessly floated through. A bizarre, noticeably British wonderland full to the brim 
             with magical keyboard solos, ethereal guitar harmonies, and some of the most haunting poetry ever to 
             exit a human's heart. Eight vastly unique, individual auditory metropolises dot the grassy English landscape,
             each evoking different emotions from those who travel through them on their journey. I wish I could
             attempt to describe each of these solitary utopias to one who had not experienced them with their own
             senses, but I would be more than unable to do them any sort of justice. With that in mind, I can tell 
             you their names. There are the four lesser wonders: I know what I like (in your wardrobe), More Fool
             Me, After the Ordeal, and Aisle of plenty. Then there are the four greater wonders: Dancing with the 
             Moonlit knight, Firth of Fifth, the Battle of Epping Forest, and the Cinema Show. It is important to
             keep in mind the fact that while I am no trained and seasoned music critic, I have listened to 
             dozens and dozens of Progressive Rock albums, yet none have come close to the power and completeness
             of this 1973 Genesis masterpiece.
     <h3>Images and Words</h3>
     <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dreamtheater/images/5/56/Images_and_Words.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090626210811"><img>
     <p> In the nineties, a musical era widely known for minimalistic, pragmatic rock and metal with a heavy DIY mindset,
         Progressive Rock was definitely not in style. Bands like Nirvana, Green Day, and Rage Against the Machine
        emphasized message over musicianship, and viewed technical/theoretical proficiency as a waste of time 
        (especially when you could get the same message across with three chords in 4/4). But as always, there 
    were those who would never forget the masterpieces of the seventies, and attempted to carry on the proud torch
    of Prog, experimenting innovating with contemporary musical norms. In my opinion, Dream Theater is the 
    best example of the Prog mindset in the modern day, and the 1992 masterpiece Images and words their 
crowning achievement. This album is the love of music lovers, and the bane of novice musicians everywhere, 
and you can expect all eight songs to bring you to tears as much as they will destroy your confidence in your
own musical abilities. Combining 80's mainstream metal, prog in the vein of Yes, and each member's 
musical genius, Images and Words is easily my top album ever from 1980 to now. Even compared to the Rest
of Dream Theater's highly impressive discography, this release stands out as their most emotionally real,
and the most well prioritized. As Dream Theater have stated in various interviews that 
the primary elements they strive to focus on in their music are:     </p>
       <uL>
           <li>Metal</li>
           <li>Melody</li>
           <li>Progressive Roots</li>
       </uL>
       <p>This record laid the groundwork for modern Prog, despite the fact that nothing has topped it since.</p>
     <h3>The Dark side of the moon</h3>
     <img src="https://media.guitarcenter.com/is/image/MMGS7/Pink-Floyd-The-Dark-Side-Of-the-Moon-LP/J47176000000000-00-500x500.jpg"></img> 
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrojrDCI02k" target="_blank">Run, rabbit run, Dig that hole, forget the sun, and when
    at last the work is done, don't sit down it's time to dig another one...</a> 
    <p>
      It's very easy to get lost in the bleak, hyperrealistic lyrics of Pink Floyd, easily labeling them as perfect
      already and unable to be topped. That is, until you take a mental step back and percieve the dreamy cloud of mellotron and guitar
    upon which the lyrics reside, and it's about at that point that you realize that this is your new favorite album. Pink Floyd's 1973
    somber masterpiece is considered one of the best albums ever, and while the individual songs are excellent 
    by themselves, it is when the album is listened to and judged as a unit that it really becomes timeless. From 
    the haunting heartbeats of Speak to Me, to the profound proclaim in "Eclipse" that there is actually no Dark
    side of the moon, the whole album flows as smoothly as a river of rainbows. Easily the least technical album
    on this list, yet some days the most meaningful, Pink Floyd's distinctly minimalistic Prog will continue to 
    inspire far into distant the future.

    <h3>Damnation</h3>

    <p>Opeth's first album to not feature growls is more likely to grab you by your heart than your headbanging 
        neck, and once it has pulled you in, you're likely to be under its complete control until the last ghostly
        hums on "Weakness". At which point the spell will be broken, in favor of a lingering sense of beautiful
        melancholia, knowing Opeth's eclectic, beautiful nightmare will only be as far away as your headphones.
        Drawing influence from Pink Floyd, Steven Wilson, and Jazz, the instrumentation on this album is definitely
        the highlight, as distortion-free guitars and easily audible basses create melodies you won't want to stop
        hearing. However, this is not to discredit or even overlook Mikael Akerfeldt's amazing clean singing,
        as his lyrics and beautiful baritone voice mix so excellently with the music that it makes you wonder
        if he himself is an instrument.
