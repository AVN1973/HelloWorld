        <h2>The Purpose of ProgWorld</h2>
        <p>I, the creator of this page, designed it with the primary intention of helping those aspiring
            fans and connoisseurs of Progressive music along the path to familiarity with the art form. Not only with 
        the albums and bands of prog, but with the stories and ideas each song aims to convey. I intend to do this by 
        presenting a set of bands and albums I consider to be not only essential, but revolutionary within the genre; the cream of
        the crop within a medium already oversaturated with innovation and originality.

       <p>Elegant, Avant-Garde, and just a bit gloomy, the cover of this album sums up the music very well. Almost giving you the impression
            that it will be predictable, until you place it in your record player and drop the needle. Fifty-three minutes later you will
        undoubtedly find yourself longing to return to the magical world of keyboard solos and guitar landscapes you just
        floated through. </p>
